This is my simple file for collecting all my data.

You can figure this out for yourself while I get all the setupfiles
right. Just remember that this is a project in progress, which will get better
over time.

To fully harness the power of these config files you need:

Echinus - WM
Canto - RSS reader
conky - realtime system info dsiplayer
mpd - music player deamon
ncmpcpp - front end for mpd
ourico - panel for Echinus
vim - The best editor :)
rxvt-unicode - My favorite terminal
zsh - A shell

The setup file relays on python.
