You can figure this out for yourself while I get all the setupfiles
right. Just remember that this is a project in progress, which will get better
over time.

To fully harness the power of these config files you need:

Awesome - WM
Canto   - RSS reader
conky   - realtime system info dsiplayer
mpd     - music player deamon
ncmpcpp - front end for mpd
vim     - The best editor :)
urxvt   - My favorite terminal
zsh     - A shell
dmenu   - A programs launcher
feh     - For setting background!

The setup file relays on python.
